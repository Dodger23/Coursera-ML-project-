# Predicting Human Activity Classe from Wearable Devices

This is a ML course project to predict human activity based on readings of wearable Devices's accelerometers.

## Goal
The goal of this project to train a random forst ML algorithm on a training data and predict human activities from 5 classes (A = sitting-down, B = standing-up, C = standing, D = walking, E =  sitting ) on a Quiz data doesn't contain the classe variable 


## Data 
The data for this project come from this source: [ Human Activity Recognition](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.) organization.

This is a dataset with 5 classes (A = sitting-down, B = standing-up, C = standing, D = walking, E =  sitting ) collected on 8 hours of activities of 6 healthy subjects using wearable devices' accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.

The training data for this project are available here:
